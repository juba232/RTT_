GEO dataset (public on June 23, 2025) with:

Single-nucleus RNA-seq of sorted MECP2-high and MECP2-low neurons

Isogenic RTT and control samples (5 patients)

Human cortical neurons

ðŸ§  Core Research Questions We Can Address:
What transcriptomic programs are directly altered by MECP2 loss?

Are there compensatory changes in MECP2+ neurons in RTT brains?

Which neuronal subtypes are most affected by MECP2 mutations?

Can we link the affected pathways to sperm-specific mechanisms of mutation bias?

Are there conserved patterns between human RTT and transgenic rat models?

ðŸ§¬ Strategic Multi-Step Approach
âœ… STEP 1: Literature-Guided Hypothesis Framing
Goal: Use existing literature to identify known MECP2 functions and mutation effects.

Survey studies such as:

Gabel et al., 2015 (Cell) â€“ MECP2 binds methylated CA sequences.

Renthal et al., 2018 â€“ Role of MECP2 in chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression.

Lombardi et al., 2021 â€“ Cell-type specific MECP2 effects in Rett brains.

Studies on paternal sperm mutation enrichment in MECP2.

Note prior reports of:

Long genes being dysregulated in MECP2-null neurons.

Glutamatergic vs. GABAergic imbalance.

Epigenetic misregulation due to methylation or histone changes.

âœ… STEP 2: Data Preprocessing
Use Seurat (R) or Scanpy (Python) for single-nucleus RNA-seq analysis.

Tasks:

QC filtering (nFeature_RNA, nCount_RNA, mitochondrial genes)

Normalize (LogNormalize or SCTransform)

Integration if samples are batched

Dimensionality reduction (PCA â†’ UMAP)

Cluster identification

Cell type annotation (using markers or references like CellTypist, SingleR)

âœ… STEP 3: DEGs and Pathway Analysis
Compare MECP2-low vs. MECP2-high within isogenic RTT brains.

Use FindMarkers() or MAST for differential expression.

Separate analysis:

RTT MECP2- vs RTT MECP2+

RTT MECP2- vs WT MECP2+

RTT MECP2+ vs WT MECP2+

Followed by:

Gene Ontology & KEGG pathway enrichment (e.g., clusterProfiler, g:Profiler)

Gene set enrichment using known neuronal or synaptic pathways.

Specific attention to:

Synaptic plasticity genes

DNA repair/methylation pathways

Neuronal subtype-specific vulnerability

âœ… STEP 4: Pseudotime and Trajectory Inference
To understand developmental impact of MECP2 loss:

Use Monocle3 / Slingshot to infer lineage trajectories.

Look for altered maturation trajectories in MECP2- neurons.

Map differentiation bottlenecks or divergence points.

âœ… STEP 5: Cross-Species Comparison
Use ortholog mapping to:

Compare human RTT DEGs with the transgenic rat RTT model data.

Use tools like biomaRt, gprofiler2, or Ensembl REST API for human-rat gene matching.

Look for conserved modules or species-specific compensation mechanisms.

âœ… STEP 6: Integration with Mutation Origin Studies
While transcriptomic data won't directly explain why sperm mutations occur, you can:

Query if DNA repair, methylation machinery, or germline-expressed genes are dysregulated.

Explore whether RTT-affected pathways overlap with spermatogenesis-related expression (cross-reference with GTEx or sperm-specific expression atlases).

Use co-expression networks (e.g., WGCNA) to identify modules enriched in both RTT neurons and sperm mutation hotspots.
